# Security foundations

The harness holds API keys and runs code that an LLM can be coerced
into producing. Two layers of controls compose to bound the blast
radius.

The **safety rings** (operator-facing, configurable) catch attacks at
the boundaries of a run — pre-flight, per tool call, in-sandbox, and
post-edit. They are documented separately in
[`safety-rings.md`](safety-rings.md). LLM-based content classification
sits in front of the rings via the `GuardRail` component
([`guardrails.md`](guardrails.md)).

The **foundations** below are the in-harness controls that are always
on. They are not configurable knobs; they are structural properties
of the codebase that make whole classes of vulnerability (secret
leakage, path traversal, SSRF, prototype pollution, unbounded
memory) hard or impossible to reintroduce.

## Secrets

### `SecretStore`

API keys are never stored in `RunConfig`. The `RunConfig` carries
`secret://` references that resolve at runtime through
`harness/internal/security/SecretStore`. Three backends ship,
auto-routed by URL scheme:

| Reference | Backend |
|---|---|
| `secret://NAME` | Environment variable `NAME` |
| `secret://file:///abs/path` | File contents at `/abs/path` |
| `secret://ssm:///param-name` | AWS SSM Parameter Store (initialised lazily) |

`AutoSecretStore` only initialises the SSM client when a config
reference requires it, so plain env-var deployments do not pay the
AWS-SDK initialisation cost.

### `RunConfig.Redact()`

Before any trace, recording, or persistent log writes the
`RunConfig`, it is run through `Redact()` which strips every
`secret://` reference, normalises provider and MCP URLs to their
origin, redacts provider API-key header names, and redacts
non-allowlisted provider query parameters. The persisted artifact
never contains anything that could be replayed against a provider.

### `LogScrubber`

The `harness/internal/observability/ScrubHandler` wraps any
`slog.Handler` and runs `security.Scrub()` on every string attribute
value before delegation. Nineteen regex patterns are scrubbed,
covering:

- Anthropic API keys
- OpenAI and Stripe API keys
- GitHub PATs and app tokens
- AWS access key IDs and key/value-anchored AWS secret access keys
- Slack tokens
- GCP API keys and OAuth2 access tokens
- Key/value-anchored Azure storage keys
- Bearer tokens including JWTs (Authorization headers; Basic auth)
- PEM-encoded private keys
- API-key header values
- Key/value-anchored 32-character hex secrets
- `secret://` references themselves

Because the scrubber sits at the `slog.Handler` boundary, secret
leakage through a misformatted log line is structurally impossible —
the scrubber runs before any handler (JSON, text, OTel log
exporter) sees the attribute.

## Input validation

All tool inputs are validated against a JSON Schema before the tool
function runs. The validator
(`harness/internal/security/inputvalidator.go`) uses
`santhosh-tekuri/jsonschema/v6` for full Draft 2020-12 support
(inline `$ref`/`$defs`, `oneOf`/`anyOf`/`allOf`, `format`, `enum`,
`pattern`, numeric bounds, array item validation).

Two hardenings apply on top of standard schema validation:

- **External schema loading is disabled.** A hostile MCP server
  cannot induce a local file read or SSRF by referencing a
  `$ref: file:///etc/passwd` or `$ref: http://attacker/...`.
- **Prototype-pollution keys are stripped.** `__proto__`,
  `constructor`, and similar are removed from the input object before
  validation, preventing schema-conforming inputs that exploit
  JS-style prototype-chain mutation in downstream tooling.

## `RunConfig` validation

`types.ValidateRunConfig` enforces hard invariants before any
component is constructed. Anything that fails validation is rejected
at config-load time, not at runtime.

The most security-relevant invariants:

- **Read-only modes** (`planning`, `review`, `research`, `toil`) must
  exclude `write_file`, `run_command`, and `edit_file` from
  `tools.builtIn`, and must not use `permissionPolicy.type=allow-all`.
- **Bounded budgets:** `maxTurns` ≤ 100, `timeout` ≤ 3600 s,
  `followUpGrace` ≤ 3600 s, `maxCostBudget` ≤ $100,
  `maxTokenBudget` ≤ 50 M.
- **Mutually exclusive credentials:** `apiKeyRef` and
  `credential.type` cannot both be set on the same provider.
- **Cedar policy file paths** reject `..` traversal segments;
  workspace-relative paths are resolved against `executor.workspace`.
- **Path-only fields** (workspace, trace, policy file, semgrep
  config) are validated for traversal and absolute-path constraints
  appropriate to their use.

## HTTP client hardening

Every provider adapter and the MCP client uses an explicit
`*http.Client` with timeouts:

| Client | Timeout |
|---|---|
| Provider streaming (Anthropic, OpenAI, OpenAI Responses, Bedrock, Gemini) | 120 s |
| MCP client | 30 s |
| Web fetch tool | 30 s |

`http.DefaultClient` is never used in production code. Error
response bodies are bounded with `io.LimitReader` to avoid
unbounded memory consumption when a provider returns an unexpectedly
large error payload.

## SSRF protection (`web_fetch`)

The `web_fetch` tool layers four checks before any HTTP request goes
out:

1. **Scheme allowlist:** only `http` and `https`. No `file://`, no
   `gopher://`, no other URL schemes.
2. **DNS resolution:** the hostname is resolved before the request is
   issued; the resolved IP is checked against the blocklist.
3. **IP block list:** RFC 1918 private ranges, loopback (127/8),
   link-local (169.254/16), and multicast (224/4 and similar) are
   rejected. This prevents cloud-metadata exfiltration
   (`169.254.169.254`) and lateral movement to internal services.
4. **Response cap:** 100 KB. Larger responses are truncated; the
   truncation is visible to the model.

## Path traversal prevention

All three `Executor` implementations enforce workspace containment:

- **`local`** uses `filepath.EvalSymlinks` to resolve symlinks
  before the path is checked, so symlink-based escapes are caught.
- **`container`** is structurally sandboxed by the container
  itself; the workspace is bind-mounted at a fixed path.
- **`api`** validates workspace-relative paths and uses
  `url.PathEscape` on every path segment before constructing the
  GitHub Contents API URL.

The `grep_files` and `find_files` tools call `ResolvePath` on the
search root before any directory walk begins, so a workspace-relative
path that escapes the workspace is rejected before the walker sees
it. `grep_files` additionally uses `shellQuote()` on every value
interpolated into the `rg` invocation. Tested against
`../../../etc/passwd`, symlink escapes, and absolute paths.

## Environment filtering

When the local executor runs a shell command, the child process's
environment is filtered to a 27-key allowlist of safe variables
(`HOME`, `PATH`, `LANG`, `LC_*`, `SHELL`, language-specific build
vars, etc.). Everything else is dropped.

The filter blocks:

- All `*_API_KEY` and `*_TOKEN` variables.
- All AWS, GCP, and Azure credential variables
  (`AWS_*`, `GOOGLE_*`, `AZURE_*`).
- The `secret://` variables that the harness itself reads.

A successful `run_command` therefore cannot leak the harness's
own credentials, even by accident, even if the model asks the
shell to print them.

## Container hardening

The container executor applies these defaults regardless of what
`RunConfig` says:

- `CapDrop: ["ALL"]`
- `SecurityOpt: ["no-new-privileges"]`
- `ReadonlyRootfs: true` — the container's root filesystem is
  immutable. All writable scratch is confined to the workspace
  bind and the explicit tmpfs mounts below, so a compromised run
  cannot persist a payload outside the paths it actually needs.
- `User: "65534:65534"` (nobody:nogroup) — the main process and
  every `run_command` exec run unprivileged, so a container escape
  lands on a non-root identity rather than uid 0.
- A 256 MiB `/tmp` tmpfs and a 64 MiB `/dev/shm`, each mounted
  `nosuid,nodev,noexec`. These provide the writable, non-executable
  scratch a read-only rootfs otherwise denies; `noexec` stops a
  dropped binary from being run out of scratch.
- `PidsLimit` from `resources.pids` (fork-bomb containment),
  alongside the CPU and memory limits from `resources`.
- `NetworkMode: "none"` (overridden to `"bridge"` only when
  `network.mode == "allowlist"`, in which case the egress proxy
  enforces FQDN allowlisting on the way out)
- A registry allowlist on `executor.image`. The default admits
  only the project's own `ghcr.io/stirrup/*` images and Docker Hub
  official `docker.io/library/*` images; any other reference is
  rejected before a container is created. Operators widen or
  replace the set via `executor.registryAllowlist` (a list of
  globs over the normalised `host/repo` reference, tag/digest
  stripped). An explicit list *replaces* the default rather than
  extending it. Digest-pinned references (`@sha256:…`) are accepted
  and preferred; cryptographic verification of the digest
  (cosign/Sigstore) is a deferred follow-up.
- API keys and `secret://` references are resolved on the *host*
  before tool dispatch; they never enter the container's
  environment.

The workspace bind is *not* mounted `nosuid,nodev,noexec`: the
Engine API exposes those options for tmpfs mounts but not for bind
mounts, and the run must be able to execute tooling it writes into
the workspace. Defence there rests on the dropped capabilities,
`no-new-privileges`, and the non-root user rather than mount flags.

Optional kernel-isolation runtime selection (`runc`, `runsc`, `kata*`)
is documented in [`safety-rings.md`](safety-rings.md).

## Untrusted context

Anything the harness receives over the network (tool outputs, web
fetch responses, MCP server replies, `dynamicContext` injected by
the control plane) is wrapped in `<untrusted_context>` tags before
being shown to the model. The mode-specific system prompt instructs
the model to treat content inside those tags as data, not
instructions. This is a probabilistic mitigation against prompt
injection; the deterministic ring is the egress allowlist (Ring 2)
and the Cedar policy engine (Ring 3) which catch the *consequences*
of a successful injection.

The `dynamicContext` map further distinguishes sensitive entries
(`sensitive: true`) so the validator can reason about Rule of Two
exposure and the loop can apply tighter handling rules.

## Stall detection

The agentic loop terminates after:

- **3 consecutive identical tool calls** (same name + same canonical
  input) — `stop_reason: "stalled"`.
- **5 consecutive tool failures** — `stop_reason: "tool_failures"`.

This bounds the damage of a model that has lost the plot — without
stall detection, a coerced or stuck model can burn through the
turn budget executing the same destructive call until something
else trips. The loop also surfaces a warning to the transport so
the control plane can react.
